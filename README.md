Duck Bot
########

Testing out the discord bot API.
Not a production ready bot, just some fun.

This bot displays ducks, just make sure the Python script is running,
add it to a server with
[this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=704133404848947230&permissions=19456&scope=bot) and run

```
!duck
```

You probably also need to setup the environment variables for your
new bot:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN = ...
```

You also need a directory with some ducks.
